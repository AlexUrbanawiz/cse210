# Tavern Keeper

Tavern keeper is a game that makes you manage your inventory with customers demands, while serving the inspectors correctly to keep your liscense.

## Usage

At the begining of the program you will be presented with a menu like this:
```bash
Pages:
1. View Inventory
2. Order Item
3. View Finances
4. Start Next Day
Enter the page you want to go to:
```
The frist page you should visit is the order item page (by entering 2) to order the food you need to start the day. Once you've orderd some food you can then start the next day (by entering 4) and begin serving customers. As you sucsessfully serve customers you will reccive money and increase your score, and the game will get harder as you go on. As your score increases the customers and inspectors will become more impatient, and you will serve more of them before the day ends and you can buy food so be sure to think ahead. You can view your finances and inventory before starting the next day (by entering 3 and 1 respectivley) which will help you make descions on what food/drinks to order for the next day. When you encounter an inspector (whos role will be shown in red) make sure to serve them correctly and quickly or you will lose your liscene and the game will end.
